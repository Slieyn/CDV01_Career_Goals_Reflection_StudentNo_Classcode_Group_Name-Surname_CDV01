                <h3>Self-Assessmet Reflection</h3>
                <h3>Skills Analysis</h3>
                   <h4>Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
                   <p> I have learnt the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and I am happy with what I know
                    because I am able to create simple websites,games,shopping page
                     and a personal portfolio. 
                    I believe there is room for improvement,
                     as I will be pushing myself to practice more, by challenging myself to create 
                    more complex projects, to put my skills into practice. 
                    I have learnt JavaScript but I find it a bit complex,
                    escpecially when I am still mastering my CSS skills. 
                    I do believe that I can improve with practice overtime, 
                    with hardwork,research,practice and consistency. 
                </p>

                    </ul>
                    In a work environment, honesty and teamwork are my top 2 key values. Transparency is important because
                    teammates do not have to worry when delegation of tasks are made, everyone is reliable. 
                    Teamwork is important. Ideas are generated effecitently and problems are solved quicker. 
                    There are a lot of values but I believe these to are the most important for the best work environment.

                While I was doing my research, I discovered that tech is very complex. 
                New skills and fundamentals are discovered and renewed everyday. AI is one of the industries that caught 
                my attention, but one thing I noticed is that it's important to master the basics.There is a link to everything.
                AI is the future and I would love to learn more about it.
                With Cybersercurity I think it's important to know about it, for safety purposes. The Tech world is dangerous
                so it's better to know how to protect your work to avoid being tech-ed out!

                    I believe it will keep me on my toes. Having the foundation of HTML and CSS will be my guide as well.
                     A lot is discovered and invented in a day. 
                    At the same time I have the understanding that we have different purposes in life,but 
                    I am eager to learn by being persistent as much as I can to gain the knowledge I need, 
                    to stand out in all the spaces I enter.
                    
                    - There is room for improvement, a lot f jobs will be replaced by IT in the next coming years.
                    With the knowledge I have with HTML and CSS, I have the advantage to be able to create websites and how they work.
                     A lot of people are starting their businesses, they use WhatsApp lines. I noticed that they can do more with the help of IT. 
                     More programs should be put out there because IT is a skill.It is the future.

                <p>Anticipated Challenges</p>
                I have realised that I need to constently do research in order to keep up with the 
                ever changing world of tech. Practice makes perfect. Time management is very important. I realised that 
                in tech you have to work fast in order to meet deadlines. Also keeping in mind that there are a lot of people
                that have far more knowledge and sklll than me that I have to keep up with. 
                I take this as motivation, because I know for a fact that there is always room for improvement. 
                The best strategy is to remain focused and continue to reseach and be the best at what I do, in order to 
                stand out.  

                <h3>Anticipated Challenges</h3>
                <p>Having great ideas can lead to investors. It's important not only vision but to also
                    create what you have and truly believe in it. With pracitce,you are able to deal with the 
                    pressures of the tech world, be able to tackle tasks and deliever solutions on times.
                    Travelling is one of the advantages with tech. You are able to travel world, meet people
                    that have knowledge. You are able to learn from them and grow.
                    
                    Networking in tech is very important, because code is not only created from scretch 
                    all the time but also improved. With a good network of people in tech it will also give 
                    me insight and an advantage of how things work, and where improvement need to take place. 
                    There are a lot of educational opportunties at hand and people need to grab on it and learn.
